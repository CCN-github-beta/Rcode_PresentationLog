# Rcode_PresentationLog
This code helps to delete the trial part in the .log file from the Presentation (neurobs) software and leave you only with the response part

# Logfile from Presentation
In most of the cases, Presentation .log files have two parts: the upper one (with trial part) and the lower one (with response part). Usually, one needs only the response part, so this short script allows to delete all trial parts for all .log files (= all participants). 

# Editing
Please, be aware that you might need to do some small adjustments since your .log files might be a bit different. This particular script was written for a specific study. If you need an example data for this script, let me know and I will share. In case of any bugs or issues, ahain, let me know.
